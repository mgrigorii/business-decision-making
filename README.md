# business-decision-making


## The project has two parts and will show you what can you do with python as a Data Analyst for business.

In part one we will see the difference between two frameworks that usually used for prioritization of hypotheses. In other words we will do prioritize a list of different hypotheses that we should work with.

We will use:
the ICE framework
the RICE framework


## The part two is a classical analysis of A-B test results.

We going to understand what to do with the Test?
  1. Stop the test, record the victory of one of the groups. 
  2. Stop the test, record the absence of differences between groups. 
  3. Continue the test.

On the way to the answer will check the data and answer on the list of business questions with python:

How to build a graph of cumulative revenue by group?
How to build a graph of the cumulative average check by groups?
How to plot the relative change in the cumulative average check of group B to group A?
How to plot the cumulative average number of orders per visitor by group?
How to plot the relative change in the cumulative average number of orders per visitor of group B to group A?
How to build a scatter plot of the number of orders by users?
How to calculate the 95th and 99th percentiles of orders per user?
How to build a scatter plot of order values?
How to calculate the 95th and 99th order value percentiles and choose a border to detect abnormal orders?
How to calculate the statistical significance of differences in the average number of orders per visitor between groups on raw data?
How to calculate the statistical significance of differences in the average check of an order between groups based on "raw" data?
How to calculate the statistical significance of differences in the average number of orders per visitor between groups on "cleaned" data?
How to calculate the statistical significance of differences in the average check of an order between groups using "cleaned" data?

In that project I will use python libraries:
  pandas
  pandas.plotting
  scipy.stats
  datetime
  numpy
  matplotlib.pyplot
  warnings
